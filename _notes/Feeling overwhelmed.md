title: Feeling overwhelmed
---
2023 was not a good year for me. I didn't learn anything or did what I wanted to do. I felt overwhelmed doing the simplest of tasks. I often find myself with awkward amount of time that's not enough to try new things. 
I occasionally write notes privately. This year, I wish to share some of the notes publicly.
